# ToDo App

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully functional ToDo application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It leverages JavaScript's ES6 features, LocalStorage for data persistence, and a third-party library (Sortable.js) for drag-and-drop functionality. Exception handling is also implemented to ensure robust user interactions.

This project showcases how JavaScript interacts with the DOM to create dynamic and interactive web applications. The modular structure separates concerns by using individual files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, adhering to best practices in web development.
